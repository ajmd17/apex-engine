### About

Apex Engine (pending name change) is a game engine written in C++. I started writing it about five or six years ago, and for a while I hadn't worked on it. Now, I'm bringing it back and enhancing it quite a bit.

Plans are in place to add support for Vulkan as well as other rendering platforms (currently it runs on OpenGL). I've begun porting it over to Metal as well using [MGL](https://github.com/openglonmetal/MGL).

Feel free to contribute anything - I'd love to have some more eyes on this project! Submit an issue if you run into anything
